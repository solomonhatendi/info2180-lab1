		<h2>Christina Solomon</h2>
		<p>Christina Solomon is a Computer Science student at The University of the West Indies. Their interests include Computer Science, illustration, cartoons, and webcomics. They have the tendency to end text missives with commas instead of periods, and capitalise the first letter of the first word following any comma.</p>
		<p>Solomon is interested in Web Development because in a time where the internet is becoming increasingly commercialised, and social media becomes more homogenous and provides less privacy, they think it is important for more people to be able to create their own websites where they can fully experiment within the scope of web development, while sharing their interests, as well as visiting others' websites to see what different kinds of ideas different people may come up with. It is also important for more people to be computer literate. And it's fun.</p>
